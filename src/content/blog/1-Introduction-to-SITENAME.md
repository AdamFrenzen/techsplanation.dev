## Hello and welcome to techsplanation.dev!

Techsplanation is a new blog site about programming and technology topics. There will mostly be tutorial/how-to posts and solutions to problems or questions.

The goal of Techsplanation is to inform in short, no fluff, easy to digest posts. 

There is also a YouTube channel for video form content. Not all posts will have a video and not all videos will correspond to a post. Video alternatives will be embedded into posts if that is more your speed, but the posts and videos will provide the same information.
